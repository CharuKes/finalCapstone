## 1. GLOBAL SITUATION

According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41,282,694.90 km<sup>2</sup> in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.90 
km<sup>2</sup>, a loss of 1,324,449.00 km<sup>2</sup>, or 3.23%. The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.99 km<sup>2</sup>).

## 2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK

In 2016, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 31.38%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 46.16%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 2.07% forestation.

In 1990, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.

| Region            | 1990 Forest Percentage | 2016 Forest Percentage | Difference between 1990 and 2016 Forest Percentage |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Latin America & Caribbean | 51.03% | 46.16% | -4.87% |
| Sub-Saharan Africa   | 30.67% | 28.79% | -1.88% |

| Middle East & North Africa | 1.78% | 2.07% | 0.29% |

The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.03% to 46.16%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (30.67% to 28.79%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large that the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.38%.

## 3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL

### A. SUCCESS STORIES

Among the countries analyzed, there are notable success stories in terms of forest area expansion. China stands out as a particularly bright spot, having experienced a substantial increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The data shows that China expanded its forest area by 527,229.06 km<sup>2</sup>, reflecting a commendable achievement. It would be beneficial to conduct further research to understand the factors and initiatives that contributed to this significant growth in forest cover.

The United States also demonstrated positive progress, albeit on a smaller scale. Over the same period, the United States increased its forest area by 79,200.00 km<sup>2</sup>, indicating efforts towards conservation and sustainable forest management. Although the increase is not as substantial as China's, it highlights the potential for growth even in large countries.

Additionally, Iceland, despite being a smaller nation, witnessed an impressive 213.66% increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016. This remarkable growth rate emphasizes the positive impact that effective forest conservation measures can have, regardless of a country's size.

### B. LARGEST CONCERNS

To identify the countries experiencing significant deforestation, we can examine the absolute and percentage decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016.

The top five countries with the largest absolute decrease in forest area are as follows:

1. Brazil: Latin America & Caribbean region - Forest area decreased by 541,510.00 km<sup>2</sup>.
2. Indonesia: East Asia & Pacific region - Forest area decreased by 282,193.98 km<sup>2</sup>.
3. Myanmar: East Asia & Pacific region - Forest area decreased by 107,234.00 km<sup>2</sup>.
4. Nigeria: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Forest area decreased by 106,506.00 km<sup>2</sup>.
5. Tanzania: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Forest area decreased by 102,320.00 km<sup>2</sup>.

When considering the percentage decrease in forest area, the top five countries are:

1. Togo: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Percentage forest area change of -75.45%.
2. Nigeria: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Percentage forest area change of -61.80%.
3. Uganda: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Percentage forest area change of -59.27%.
4. Mauritania: Sub-Saharan Africa region - Percentage forest area change of -46.75%.
5. Honduras: Latin America & Caribbean region - Percentage forest area change of -45.03%.

It is crucial to note that four out of the top five countries with the highest percentage decrease in forest area are located in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. These countries, including Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania, require immediate attention and targeted interventions to address deforestation challenges. Honduras in the Latin America & Caribbean region also faces significant deforestation issues and needs urgent action.

### C. QUARTILES

Analyzing the data by quartiles provides insights into the distribution of forestation percentages among countries in 2016. The countries are grouped into quartiles based on their forestation percentages.

The distribution of countries in each quartile in 2016 is as follows:

1st Quartile: 85 countries
2nd Quartile: 72 countries
3rd Quartile: 38 countries
4th Quartile: 9 countries

The largest number of countries, 85 in total, falls within the 1st quartile, indicating that a significant portion of countries has a relatively low percentage of land designated as forested.

In contrast, only 9 countries are in the 4th quartile, representing countries with a high percentage of forested land. These countries, which include Suriname, Micronesia, Gabon, Seych

## 4. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of global deforestation trends from 1990 to 2016. The findings reveal both success stories and areas of concern regarding forest area changes at the global, regional, and country levels.

The global situation shows a concerning decrease in forest area, with a loss of 1,324,449.00 km<sup>2</sup>, equivalent to 3.23% of the total forest area. This loss exceeds the land area of Peru, highlighting the magnitude of the issue. 

Regionally, Latin America & Caribbean experienced a significant decrease in forest area, while Sub-Saharan Africa also faced notable challenges. Other regions witnessed increases in forest area, indicating the potential for positive change.

Among the countries analyzed, China, the United States, and Iceland demonstrated remarkable success in expanding their forest areas. Their achievements underscore the importance of effective conservation efforts and sustainable forest management practices.

However, countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Mauritania, and Honduras experienced substantial deforestation, requiring immediate attention and targeted interventions.

The quartile analysis reveals that a large number of countries have relatively low forestation percentages, highlighting the need for global efforts to promote afforestation and sustainable land management practices.

In conclusion, this report serves as a call to action, urging governments, organizations, and individuals to prioritize forest conservation, restoration, and sustainable practices. Collaboration, policy interventions, and community engagement are crucial to addressing deforestation challenges and preserving our valuable ecosystems.

Let this report serve as a catalyst for change, inspiring collective efforts towards a greener and more sustainable future. By taking decisive action today, we can ensure the preservation of our planet's forests for generations to come and foster a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.
