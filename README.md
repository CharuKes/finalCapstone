# Final Capstone
The final capstone project was divided into two parts: NLP 1 and NLP 2. NLP 1 explored text classification techniques in email folder allocation, essay grading assistance and  Diagnostic Assistive Technology. NLP 2 focused on Google Assistant, utilizing advanced NLP algorithms for intelligent question answering and natural language interactions.
## NLP1
The use-case analysis highlights three applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These include email folder allocation using text classification, essay grading assistance through predefined criteria, and diagnostic assistive technology leveraging question-answering techniques. These examples showcase the diverse functionalities and benefits of NLP in managing emails, grading essays, and aiding in medical diagnoses.
## NLP2
Google Assistant, available on smartphones and smart speakers, utilizes advanced NLP techniques to provide intelligent question answering and natural language interactions. Developed by Google, it integrates cutting-edge NLP algorithms and language models to understand and respond effectively to user queries. By leveraging deep learning models and advanced linguistic analysis, Google Assistant delivers accurate and timely information, performs tasks, and offers personalized assistance, facilitating seamless communication and efficient task completion.
